Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the release of my video player project built with Flutter! This application provides a smooth and responsive experience for playing videos, complete with features like play/pause, volume control, and fullscreen mode. Leveraging Flutter's powerful capabilities, I've created a user-friendly interface that works across multiple platforms. Check out the code, and feel free to contribute or share your feedback. Enjoy exploring!
